# About Me
Hello my name is Clark Milholland but I tend to go by 'CJ' which stands for Clark Jr. But I am not actually a legal junior nor do I have Jr or CJ on any of my legal documents.
It is just a family nickname. 

At the time of writing this I am just finishing up a 5 month trip through some of Central and South America. 
On that trip I visited Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, and Panama. 
Prior to this trip through South America I worked as a Senior Enterprise Account Engineer at Amazon Web Services, more specifically AWS Elemental.
In this role I worked as a technical advisor of sorts for our largest customers.
A normal day consisted of working directly our customers, engaging with our software engineers and product teams, reviewing workflow designs, projecting viewer behavior and ensuring that all parts of the workflow are scaled and tested for whatever the next live event would be.
Beyond this I would also participate in live support and monitoring during key customer events helping mitigate and resolve any issues that arrive.

Now that I am back from my travels I have decided that I would like to focus my free time and energy on learning as much about AI as I can.

My goal is to use these github pages to document my learning journey deeper into the world of AI.

While I was attending a spanish school in Colombia I used AI to build some simple training and learning tools to help me learn spanish.
I posted most of these tools to https://cjspanish.com
Moving forward I would like to leverage cjspanish.com as a playground for further AI exploration. With the first goal being to build an interface to a chatbot which roleplays some basic situations like ordering food at a resturant.

Hopefully github pages is simple and pain free enough to keep me coming back and updating this website with all of my new learnings and possible a section better documenting my travels in South America.
